# ha-noaa-space-weather

*NOAA space weather data in Home Assistant.*

This project consists of an external MQTT server, a custom component, and custom dashboard cards. Works well with [tcarwash/home-assistant_noaa-space-weather](https://github.com/tcarwash/home-assistant_noaa-space-weather).

Individual components have their own README files.
